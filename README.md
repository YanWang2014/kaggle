# Titanic

Hi friends,

I am a beginner to kaggle and genetic programming. I have tried to implement a small GP code for Titanic, following deap/examples/gp/symbreg.py and Genetic Programming LB ~ 0.88.

After a few trials, I have obtained LB~0.78947. Since I am not an expert in GP, I have no idea how to tune the algorithms to obtain better results. If you do, I hope you can share your ideas or code with me. Thanks!

Best, Yan
